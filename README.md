# Motivation

This bot was created for the [DevCord Discord Server](https://discord.gg/gfEsr79d9a). \
We needed a way to identify valuable users in our community. Most bots do these by chat activity.\
Sadly chat a high activity doesn't mean that a user is valuable for the community.\
That is where the reputation bot comes in place.

# How does it work

The reputation bot will scan messages for thank phrases, which you can define.\
When a thank phrase is found the bot will try to find the receiver of the message. This is done by several checks.

- Answer: You can answer the message which helped you with a thank word.
- Mention: You can mention the user which helped you with a thankword
- Fuzzy: You can write the name, or a part of the name relative to a thank word, and the bot will try to find the user.

As an alternative you can also give a reputation reaction to the message which helped you.

After a user has given another user a reputation he has to wait a configurable amount of minutes until he can give this
user reputation again.\
Also if a message is older than a configurable amount no reputation will be given when someone answers it or adds a
reaction.

# Can I backfill my reputation

You can use the scan command to scan up to 100k messages in a channel for thank words. This will take some time. You can
only scan one channel at a time.

# Self hosting

Use the docker compose file in the docker directory. Otherwise do the stuff below.

Build from source. No specific setup besides a JDK with an appropriate version is required to compile the bot yourself.

You will need a PostgreSQL database and Java 18 or higher. Copy the log4j config from resources to your wished
destination. I suggest a config directory

Start the bot with the following parameter. You may change the path.

``` sh
-Dlog4j.configurationFile=config/log4j2.xml -Dbot.config=config/config.json
```

After the first start a config will be created, and the bot will fail to start. Configure the bot and start it again.
