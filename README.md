# Motivation

This bot was created for the [DevCord Discord Server](https://discord.gg/gfEsr79d9a). \
We needed a way to identify valuable users in our community. Most bots do these by chat activity.\
Sadly chat a high activity doesn't mean that a user is valuable for the community.\
That is where the reputation bot comes in place.

# How does it work

The reputation bot will scan messages for thank phrases, which you can define.\
When a thank phrase is found the bot will try to find the receiver of the message. This is done by several checks.

- Answer: You can answer the message which helped you with a thank word.
- Mention: You can mention the user which helped you with a thankword
- Fuzzy: You can write the name, or a part of the name relative to a thank word, and the bot will try to find the user.

As an alternative you can also give a reputation reaction to the message which helped you.

After a user has given another user a reputation he has to wait a configurable amount of minutes until he can give this
user reputation again.\
Also if a message is older than a configurable amount no reputation will be given when someone answers it or adds a
reaction.

You can invite the bot with
this [link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=834843896579489794&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=1342532672). \
Or if you dont trust me you can host it by yourself.

# Can I backfill my reputation

You can use the scan command to scan up to 100k messages in a channel for thank words. This will take some time. You can
only scan one channel at a time.

# Self hosting

Use the docker compose file in the docker directory. Otherwise do the stuff below.

Build from source. You probably need to build my library on localhost currently because jitci hates gradle.

You will need a PostgreSQL database and Java 15 or higher. Copy the log4j config from resources to your wished
destination. I suggest a config directory

Start the bot with the following parameter. You may change the path.

``` sh
-Dlog4j.configurationFile=config/log4j2.xml -Dbot.config=config/config.json
```

After the first start a config will be created, and the bot will fail to start. Configure the bot and start it again.

# Setup on your server

All commands are also available as slash commands.

- The default prefix is `!`
- Set your language with `!locale set <language>`.
- Set a manager role with `!roles managerRole <role>`. Users with this role can manage the bot settings.
- Set your reputation roles with `!roles add <role> <reputation>`
- Set your thankwords with `!tw add <pattern>`. Look below for some examples. You can also load default thankwords for
  your language with `!ts loaddefault <language>`
- Optional: `Use !tw check <sentence>` to check if your thankwords are matching the messages.
- Set channel where reputation can be received with `!channel add <channel...>`. You can set multiple channel with one
  command.

## Optional steps

- Use the `!scan -n <messages>` to can messages in the current channel for reputation phrases. `!scan -n 10000` will
  scan the last 10k messages in the current channel. You can scan up to 100k messages on one channel.
- Change the prefix with `!prefix set <prefix>`.
- Set your reputation emote with `!rs reaction <emote>`. This emote will be added by the bots to messages which received
  or gave reputation.
- Use `!rs` command to tweak the reputation settings or stick with the defaults.

You can use `!rep` to see your own reputation or `!rep <user>` to see another ones reputation.\
The ranking is available with `!rep top`

## Example thankwords

This section contains thankword pattern for some languages which we think are suitable.\
German: `thx`, `thank[a-z]*?`, `danke[a-z]*?`\
English: `thx`, `thank[a-z]*?`

Thankwords are not case sensitive.\
The should never match any spaces. You can use this [page](https://www.regextester.com/) to build your expressions.\
If you found some good pattern feedl free to tell me :3
